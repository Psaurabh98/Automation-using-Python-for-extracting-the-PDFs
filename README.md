# Automation-using-Python-for-extracting-the-PDFs

In one of our recent projects, we encountered a challenge where stakeholders needed to download PDFs of a Tableau dashboard based on different filter combinations,
to solve this, I developed a Python script that automates the PDF extraction process from dashboards published on Tableau Server or Tableau Cloud.
This repository contains the code and instructions to help others automate the same process and avoid manual PDF downloads.
